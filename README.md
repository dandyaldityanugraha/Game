# Catch the Book of Mormon

This project is a simple, interactive game built as a final project for a religion course. It combines classic arcade gameplay with a meaningful spiritual reflection.

## What Is This Game?

"Catch the Book of Mormon" is a straightforward game where the player's goal is to move a character left and right to catch falling copies of the Book of Mormon. The game is designed to be easy to learn and play. After missing three books, the game ends and transitions to a special reflection screen.

The focus is not on achieving a high score, but on the experience that follows the gameplay.

## The Purpose of This Project

The main purpose of this game is to provide an interactive and engaging way for players to think about the importance of the Book of Mormon in their lives. In our fast-paced world, it can be easy to let the scriptures "fall" past us. This game uses that simple metaphor to encourage a moment of introspection.

At the end of each game, players are invited to answer a few questions about their personal relationship with the scriptures, turning a simple game into a tool for testimony and self-reflection.

## Why I Created This Game

I built this game as my final project for my REL 122: Book of Mormon II class. My goal was to create something more than just a presentation or an essay; I wanted to build an *experience* that connects digital interaction with personal faith.

This project is a representation of my journey this semester in studying the Book of Mormon. It's my attempt to use modern skills to share a timeless message and to create a unique way for others to consider the impact of this sacred book on their own lives.

## Automatic Email Notifications

When a player completes a game and submits their reflection, an email notification is automatically sent to the administrator.

- **No Setup Needed:** This system is built-in and requires no configuration.
- **Instant Alerts:** You will receive an email immediately after a reflection is submitted.
- **Content:** The email will inform you of the submission and include the player's name. To see the full reflection details, you can open the game and use the "View All Reflections" feature.

This ensures you are always aware of how people are interacting with your project.
